Android-ReactiveProgramming
===========================

This is a sample app that is part of a serie of blog posts I will be writting about experience with Reactive Programming on Android.

[1 - Blog post: RxJava Observable tranformation: concatMap() vs flatMap()](http://fernandocejas.com/2015/01/11/rxjava-observable-tranformation-concatmap-vs-flatmap/)


Local Development
-----------------

Here are some useful Gradle/adb commands for executing this example:

 * `gradlew clean build` - Build the entire example.
 * `gradlew installDebug` - Install the debug apk in the current connected device.
